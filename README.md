I am thinking of a game with two main windows or modals. One is called “EMOJI IDEAS MASHER”; the second is called “Grid for Idea Mapper.” EMOJI IDEA MASHER has a title area, Rack and Grid. 


The “Grid for Idea Mapper” is a 12 x 16 grid in a WindowsForm window. The cells of the grid are sized equally to fit 74% of the screen with 3em borders on the rows with another below or above it and the columns with another column to the left or right. None of the rows or columns have borders on their outside most row or column. Starting 2nd row being 8 columns across, starting in row 2, column 3. It is called “Rack”. Below that, starting in the 3rd row, 3rd column is an 8x8 grid called MAPPER.  Below that, in the 11th row is one called “Clusters”. To the right of the word “Rack” is a button that says “More Emojis.” This button enables the Emojis modal to show up. Next to the word “Clusters” is the a button which says “New Cluster”.

“Emojis For Idea Mapper” looks like this: three columns, with the first and third the same size and the middle double. There is a column for “Genre(s)”, “Emoji(s)”, and “Meaning(s)”. Starting on the left is the Genre and a list of emoji genres; it has the title “Genre(s)”. In the middle, scrollable list of say 50 emojis, scrollable down; it has the title “Emojis”; it has a scrollbar indicating that one can scroll down for more emojis. On the right, a column for meanings, entitled “Meaning(s)”. In the middle of this column it has a Search text box, where one can put in a word to see emojis matching it; the matching emojis would show up in the middle column. Finally at the bottom of this column is a “Done Choosing Emojis” button (in three lines, Done/Choosing/Emojis).


When someone hovers their mouse over a genre and clicks on it, the emojis fitting that genre show up in the middle. 


When someone then chooses an emoji, its meaning shows up in the rightmost column, under “Meaning(s).” One can choose emojis by brining up groups of them, by choosing a genre; or one can choose from emojis matching a word typed into the Search text box.


When someone double-clicks an emoji, it is placed on a gameboard, in the RACK. In the lower righthand corner of the emojis modal is a button that says DONE. It makes the EmojiIdea Mapper gameboard come to the foreground.


When an emoji is chosen from the modal, it shows up on the RACK. When the Rack has 8 emojis, then a player may begin placing them on the board. To place an emoji on the board, the player clicks on it and drags it to a spot on the board. When the Rach has less than 8 emojis on it, Clusters are formed when >2 emojis adjacent to one another are clicked on in succession by the player and then the New Cluster buttom is pushed.  The group of emojis is added, one after the other, in a list under the CLUSTERS title.
